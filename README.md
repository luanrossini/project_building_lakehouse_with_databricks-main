## Business case:
A telecommunications company is a high-speed internet provider, serving a broad base of residential and business customers. The company's network infrastructure consists of multiple servers distributed across different locations to ensure service quality.

The person responsible for monitoring the company's network and servers faces challenges in ensuring that the infrastructure operates efficiently and that customers receive the best possible connection experience. Recently, he noticed that due to increased demand, some servers are overloaded and need to be upgraded to meet the demand. He needs to monitor in real-time the number of devices connected to each server as well as the connection usage rate. Additionally, he must identify whether customers are consuming a significant amount of bandwidth to ensure they receive the service they subscribed to.

Upon analyzing the data, he discovered that the company is experiencing an increase in the number of connected devices, causing network slowdowns and impacting the customer experience. He identified some customers who are using a disproportionate amount of bandwidth, which affects the connection quality for others. The responsible person proposed upgrading the servers to increase connection capacity and improve service quality. Additionally, he suggested implementing measures to identify and limit excessive bandwidth usage by some customers.
